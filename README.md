Academy
=======

Academy is a little project about natural language statistics.
It contains a word checker in `academy.py` that goes on Wikitionary and Wikipedia to find out whether words exists (and store them locally to avoid flooding). Then there is an example of use — `check_words.py` — that check words from a given file. And in order to get some sample data, `lemonde.py` will dump paragraphs from last articles published on LeMonde.fr.
